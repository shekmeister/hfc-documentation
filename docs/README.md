# Hyena Fight Club Whitepaper

## Introduction

***"We don't laugh for fun, it's our call of Dominance."***

Hyena Fight Club is a sacred band of warriors who forever stand united against all odds. They are here to take over the Solana Blockchain and restore peace and order amongst society. The Hyena Warriors share an unwavering bond and never fail to have each others back. Their strength lies in their numbers and together, they are an unstoppable force. 

Our Project offers two NFT collections; Male Hyena Warriors and the Female Hyena Warriors (coming soon). Hyena Fight Club has been meticulously constructed by talented artists and industry specialists whose primary objective is to deliver a worthwhile and meaningful investment to our holders whilst simultaneously fostering a strong and united community of like minded individuals.

Each Hyena is completely unique and has been programmatically generated from over 90 possible traits.

## Our Characters
Hyenas are valiant creatures that symbolize resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Their sheer fearlessness and adherence to their packs were our sources of inspiration for this project. We hope to cultivate a tight-knit community that takes after a pack of Hyenas.

Every NFT is ranked on basis of the rarity of its traits. Holders can view the aforementioned rarities on our website.

### Female Hyena Warriors
2222 Female Hyena Warriors will be let loose into the Solana Blockchain in the near future. Female Hyenas rank the highest on the Social Heirarchy of a Pack. They are bigger and stronger than the males and are the LEADERS of the Pack.

### Male Hyena Warriors
4444 Male Hyena Warriors roam freely in the Solana Blockchain. They are the infantry of the Pack and are subordinate to the Female Hyenas. All the packs heavy lifting is done by the Males whereas the decision making is left to the Females.
