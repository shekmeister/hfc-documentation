# Hyena Fight Club Whitepaper

## Introduction

***"We don't laugh for fun, it's our social status in the jungle."***

Hyena Fight Club is an avant-garde, community-driven NFT project based on the Solana Blockhain. Our project comes with two collections; Male Warrior Hyenas and Female Warrior Hyenas (In the near future). HFC has been meticulously put together by talented artists and industry-specialists whose primary objective is to deliver a worthwhile and meaningful investment to our holders. 

## Our Characters
Hyenas are valiant creatures that symbolize resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Their sheer fearlessness and adherence to their packs were our sources of inspiration for this project.

Each Hyena is completely unique and has been programmatically generated from over 45 possible traits. Hyenas are ranked "Common", "Uncommon", "Rare" or "Legendary" depending of the rarity of their traits. 

> Holders will be able to view the rarity of their NFTs on our website.

## Giving back
All of us here at Hyena Fight Club are serious animal lovers. We are committed to helping them in anyway that we can. Therefore, a percentage of all post-sales royalties will be pledged to a charitable organization dealing with the protection and conservation of animals chosen by our Discord Community.

> A minimum of 5% of all post-sales royalties will be donated.
