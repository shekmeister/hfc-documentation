# Hyena Brawlz

Hyena Brawlz will be a PvP (player versus player) **arcade-style fighting** game-mode. In this game mode, players will be able to fight their NFTs against other players' NFTs.

## Requirements

To play this game-mode, players will be required to own a minimum of:
- **1 x Male Hyena Warrior**, or
- **1 x Female Hyena Warrior**

Players will be able to choose any NFT from their owned collection to be used in a match.

## Gameplay

In the Hyena Brawlz game-mode, players with NFTs of similar **Rankings** (or rarities) will be matched together in an arena to fight against each other. Each Match will have **5 rounds** and will be played in a **"Best of 5"** format, i.e, the first player to win **3 out of the 5** rounds wins. Players will have to battle it out and bring their opponent's health down to *"ZERO"* in order to win a round. 

As players continue to win matches, they would gain **XP** (experience points. Now, the XP of every individual player would be reset at the beginning of every month, which marks the beginning of a **new Season**. 

The top three players with the highest XPs at the end of each season (every month) will be awarded a share from the prize-fund (in the form of **$HUNTZ tokens**). The Winner of each Season will walk away with the largest share from the prize-fund whilst the runner-ups will be awarded accordingly.

### Character select

Players will be prompted to **select a character** (Hyena NFT) before looking for a match. They can equip **any of their owned NFTs** to use in this game-mode to fight against other players. Newly bought NFTs will also show up in the list of characters a player can choose from.


### Matchmaking

As mentioned earlier, each NFT has its own set of perks depending upon its rarity rank. For example, "Legendary" NFTs will be **significantly stronger** than "Rare", "Uncommon" or  "Common" NFTs.

Therefore, to keep gameplay as fair and even as possible, a matchmaking system will be implemented to match players whose NFTs are similar in **Ranking** or strength. Another factor determined by the matchmaking system will be the **player XPs**. Only players with comparable XPs will be matched against each other in order to keep the game-mode fun and easy to get into for newcomers.

> All ranks of Female Hyena Warriors will be stronger than the Male Hyenas.
