# The Pack DAO

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization or simply, A DAO, is a organization that is controlled by its members and not influenced by a central authoritative figure, in other words it is a community without a centralized leadership.   

## Governance

DAO governance, in our case, is coordinated using NFTs that grant voting powers. Admission to The Pack DAO is limited to holders who have a confirmed ownership of Hyena Fight Club NFTs in their Web3 wallets. A seperate channel of communication will be established just for the members of The Pack.

Members of the community will cast their votes to decide the future direction of this project and can provide new ideas for the team to execute for the project's benefit.

> Voting power is proportional to the number of NFTs owned by an individual member.

## Community 

We aim to foster an engaging, cooperative and tight-knit community of like-minded individuals that collaborate on The Pack DAO and with our team to benefit the project and its members. Members of The Pack will be ranked on basis of NFTs they own and the weightage of their votes will increase accordingly.
