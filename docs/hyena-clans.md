# Way of The Pack

**Way of The Pack** will be a next-generation Web3 game and will be built on the Solana Blockchain. Holders of Hyena Fight Club NFTs are eligible to participate in this one of a kind experience.

## The Characters

Hyena Fight Club NFT holders will be able to use their NFTs as in-game assets in our upcoming game. Each NFT is ranked "**Common**", "**Uncommon**", "**Rare**", or "**Legendary**" based on the rarity of its traits. For example, "Legendary" NFTs will be **significantly stronger** than "Rare", "Uncommon" or  "Common" NFTs.

Consequently, the rarity of each NFT would directly influence the perks possessed by them. 
> *Users can view the rarity of their NFTs on our website and in-game.*

## Game Modes

The two current planned game-modes for Way of The Pack are:
- **Hyena Brawlz**: A PvP (players-vs-player) arcade-style fighting game mode.
- **The Pack**: A PvE (players-vs environment) arcade-style survival game mode.

Both these game modes offer players an avenue of earning our $HUNTZ tokens which can be exchaned for $SOL. We will be adding more game-modes in the future.

> Holders will **NOT** be able to utilise *staked NFTs* in either game-mode.
