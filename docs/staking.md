# HFC Staking

## Introduction

Staking of NFTs refers to the locking of NFTs for certain amounts of time on a platform or protocol to receive staking rewards and other privileges. In our case the rewards offered by Hyena Fight Club to Stakers will be **$HUNTZ** tokens. 

Staking is also the **primary** method of distributing tokens tokens amongst holders in order to establish an ecosystem around our token. 

> Staking will be implimented our 3rd Phase, after Mint II (Female Hyena Warriors).

## Staking information

The minimum period for holders to stake their NFTs will be 24 hours. By staking your NFTs, you will receive 5 $HUNTZ tokens every day (subject to change) for every NFT that's staked. 

There will be one staking period every month which lasts for 15 days. Holders will not be able to stake their NFTs before or after this set period.
